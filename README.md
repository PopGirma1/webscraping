sample code is give above.  live.php.  file.  but the whole project is linked on other free hosting site.

just i replaced livenews.php.  by live.php.  maybe you will not find live.php in the link below so don't confuse if i can 
i will add the whole project to this site after i get broad band(fast connection ) till that 

since it is very large file i can't abe to upload here 

just go to this site i have already put a link to it. 

just click. htdocs and you will get all the codes there.
